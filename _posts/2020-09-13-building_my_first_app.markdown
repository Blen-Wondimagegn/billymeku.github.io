Building my first App 
Starting out this week working on my first project was a bit overwhelming and difficult for me due many reasons. I am going to be sharing the process and how I overcame some of these issues. As far as getting data from a website, I decided to go with scraper.  
First, I had a hard time finding a website that was interesting to me and at the same time had valuable information for me to work with or enough data to scrape. I am not going to lie, it took me several hours to find the right website. After hours and hours of searching, I am came across this website :

https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/planet-earth/how-do-we-read-the-rocks/three-types. 

The first thing you would say when you see this website is that it is neat. I liked this website because the concept of Geology and rocks has always fascinated me, and the information it contained was short and precise. 

Here are some steps I followed before starting my project:

 1. After carefully looking through the website, I made a list of things that could possibly be used as a menu(look for lists).
 
 2.If you are going to go with Scraper, I highly recommend experimenting with this
         https://repl.it/@TheGingertonic/ScraperChecker.
				 
 3. As it is my first project I focused on implementing all the lessons I have learnt and understanding how object relation works.
   
 4.To get more idea about opprating cli and scraping this video help me out a lot https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwBMwZ89Hj8&list=PLc6AmvC5Zybybc-NjUUwQwTtUEXH4iB2s&index=2&t=
 
My cli project is a database for the three rock types,It contains bin and lib directory, the bin directory is where I actually run my ruby file. In my lib diectory I have my cli,scraper and rock files. In my cli file is where I interact with the user using a menu that loops until the user wants to exit. The most challenging part of my project was executing the menu method that I had in my cli class inside the lib directory. So the issue that Iwas having was that I was able to grab all the right data from the website and display that data but when it comes to picking a specific option It didnâ€™t that is where .all + my rock class (Rock.all) came in handy. Next I was having a hard time looping through my menu method still but I finally figured it out with( loop do) and this was the final result for the menu method.

def menu
      loop do 
         puts "Please pick a rock type for more details, Enter 0 to exit:"
         puts "**********************************************************"
         list_rock_type
         input = gets.chomp
         if input.to_i.between?(1, Rock.all.count)
                selected_rock = Rock.all[input.to_i-1]  
                puts "You have chosen => #{selected_rock.rock_name}"
                puts "******************************************"
                puts "What information would you like to find out?"
                puts "*******************************************" 
                puts "Enter 1 for breif description"
                puts "Enter 2 for examples"
                puts "Enter 3 for properties"  
                input = gets.chomp.to_i 
                if input == 1 
                    puts "Here is some description about #{selected_rock.rock_name}:"
                    puts "***************************************************"
                    puts selected_rock.rock_decription
                elsif input == 2
                    puts "Here is some examples for #{selected_rock.rock_name}:"
                    puts "*********************************************"
                    puts selected_rock.rock_example
                elsif input == 3
                    puts "Here is some uniq properties about #{selected_rock.rock_name}:"
                    puts "**************************************************"
                    puts selected_rock.rock_property
                end  
            elsif !input.to_i.between?(0, Rock.all.count)   
            puts "Rock type not found, Please try again" 
           end
            break if input.to_i == 0
    end
